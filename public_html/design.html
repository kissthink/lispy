 <h2>Design</h2>

 <p>Lispy is a Common Lisp package management system similar to
 clbuild, cllibrarian, ASDF-install, Edi Weitz's STARTER-PACK, clget,
 Lispbox, Lisp in a Box, the package management systems in the Debian
 and Gentoo Linux distributions and the Common Lisp Controller.  With
 Lispy, a user can obtain a list of installable packages,
 install/upgrade packages automatically and have an ASDF configuration
 written for them.</p>

 <p>Lispy was born out of my own experience with above systems, but
 especially ASDF-Install and the Common Lisp Controller.  I wanted a
 dependable list of Lisp packages that had gone through some level of
 integration testing but I didn't want a Linux distribution dependent
 or OS specific system.</p>

 <p>Lispy consists of two components: The Lispy source code and a
 respository containing a package map and packages.  The package map
 contains package meta data and dependency information.  A Lispy
 Package Map can be found in the root of a Lispy repository.  There
 can be many maps (which can be merged), but the one offered by the
   Lispy project is found here: <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/lispy/repository/map.lisp-expr">http://common-lisp.net/project/lispy/repository/map.lisp-expr</a></p>
