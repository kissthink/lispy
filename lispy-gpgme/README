* Introduction

This is a fork of the Common Lisp bindings in GPGME 1.1.4 and
LIBGPG-ERROR 1.6.  The goal of this project is to produce an ASDF
installable, or Lispy installable version of GPGME-CL which does not
require external tools (such as AWK).

It would be good to somehow merge this back into upstream so their own
source archives are ASDF installable.

* Differences With Upstream

gpg-error-parse.lisp   parse .in files and define-errors macro for
                       creating the defcenum form
gpg-error.asd          include gpg-error-parse.lisp component
gpg-error-codes.lisp   include template from AWK script, call
                       define-errors
gpg-error.lisp         c-gpg-err-code-from-syserror CFFI fix (for no
                       args, omit args list entirely)

* Dependencies

CFFI 0.9.2 (later snapshots will probably not work)
