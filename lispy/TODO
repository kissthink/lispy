* GPGME-CL

Had to define gpgme::translate-to-foreign (value (type (eql
'gpgme::gpgme-data-t).  Need to figure out why and suggest a patch.

* GPGME-CL

The GPGME source archive includes lang/cl for a Common Lisp ASDF
system.  It is not directly usable by Lispy since it depends on an AWK
script for converting C error code files to a Common Lisp source file.
It looks like it was designed for installation into
/usr/share/common-lisp/source which is a Debian/Gentoo Common Lisp
Controller path.

A (hopefully) short-lived fork of GPGME-CL is used by Lispy which
includes the C error files but parses them at compile time (all in
Lisp, not AWK) to create the necessary bindings.  Need to figure out
how to integrate that with GPGME upstream so that both approaches can
work.

* Dependency Resolution During Upgrade

cl-ppcre 2.0.0 depended on new package cl-unicode, but cl-unicode
wasn't installed when cl-ppcre was upgraded to 2.0.0.
